# Sunny-s-Asteroid-Mining-Scripts
The 3 Scripts for Automatic Asteroid Mining in The Perfect Tower 2

Should work on most resolutions 

I've Baseline set the time it takes to mine all asteroids to 50 seconds (Change that in the "Dos.Asteroid (Edited)" Script in line Number 1)

I've baseline set the scanning duration of an asteroid to 1 second (Change that in the "Asteroid Buyer" Script in line number 2)


All 3 scripts are needed to run the programm 

(Based on Dosbo0ts Asteroid collection script)
